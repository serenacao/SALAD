A user wants to start going to the gym as a New Year's resolution, but realizes that they've never actually been able to keep up the motivation for a resolution. They sign up for GymWitness to hopefully find ways to stay motivated. After signing up for a membership at their local gym, they go to the Network tab and find others who attend the same gym. They send friend requests to a couple people and they accept. The user soon recieve a workout challenges to do 10 pullups every day for a week. They go to the gym and pick one of the template workouts and complete it,marking easch set as done as they go, then do the pullup challenge. Since the user knows they need verification to get points for this challenge, they bring their roommate along to the gym, and have them verify it with their email. The user can then go to the challenges tab in the app and view both their own progress and the challenger's progress on the pullup challenge. The user feels extra motivated to win the challenge, and knows they will complete it since they have their roommate to keep them accountable.
