Our main concept is the Challenges concept, which allows workout challenges to be created, issued and completed. Login/UserAuthentication allows user data to be properly separated. Friending and Chat allows users to connect with other gym goers. The Leaderboard supports competition. Users can discuss challenges and leaderboard statistics with their friends through chat. Challenges can also be issued by Groups, which can help users get connected to larger networks of people.

Our main ethical concern is that users may abuse the point system by faking completion of challenges or overranking the level of their exercises. But since the main point of this app is building healthy workout habits, the natural consequence of this abuse is just worse results. So there’s not much point to abusing the point system. The point system is a fun perk, but not really anything worth faking things for.

We are also concerned that beginner users may be too ambitious with their challenges. To address this, we plan to populate the app with some default beginner challenges.

The issues that remain unclear are exactly which UI pages we need and whether challenges should be public or not.
