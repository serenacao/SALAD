# Problem Framing

## Domain

Gym/Working out: It can be tough to keep track of workout routines, and one can forget when they decided to workout especially when they first begin, have other events going on in their life, or are afraid of going to workout for one reason or another.

## Problem

Improving Workout Consistency:
Going to the gym by yourself can get tough. You may have other events distracting you or may not be comfortable going to the gym by yourself. Not everyone is comfortable being in a gym, and life gets tough with work and leads to pushing your workout to another day. However, when you involve other people in your gym journey, they can push you to improve your workout habits, such as working out more often, and help you learn new exercise routines.

5. [Working out was way easier with a buddy - “Couple years ago when I still went to the gym I was only able to do it bc I had a gym buddy. Without my friend I didn’t even think about going there. So maybe a workout buddy might help. Nowadays I grab a friend and go on a hike once every 1-2 months … by myself though? Nope.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/16f4v6l/struggling_to_exercise_regularly_how_do_you_form/)

## Comparables

1. [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) Strava is a popular fitness app where you can track your training and connect with the community, forming run clubs and competing for points. It doesn’t have an official way to verify what you do, however, so it’s not hard to cheat the system. It also focuses specifically on running, so not much of community for those who prefer other activities

2. [Gymverse](https://fitness22.com/our-apps/) Gymverse is a virtual coach that keeps track of gym progress and has a library of exercise tutorials. It has a lot of great information for beginners, but doesn’t really have a social aspect

3. [GymBuddy](https://www.gymbuddyapp.com/) GymBuddy is an app to find people to work out with in your area. It has a strong social aspect and helps manage logistics like booking classes, but doesn’t keep track of any actual progress

4. [Stridekick](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stridekick.Stridekick) Stridekick allows you to compete in activity challenges with your friends and family and use your smart watch to log points, keeping you accountable for your workouts. This app only focuses on walking/running.

5. [Shred](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.shred.android) SHRED allows you to reach your fitness goals via an AI personal trainer while having a large community of friends + strangers who are working alongside you - “Got this app so my boyfriend and I could match workout routines and keep track of our progress and weights.”

## Features

1. Exercise Challenges: Friends can issue challenges to each other (can issue challenges to multiple people, forming a challenge group), e.g. (large challenges, like 4x a week for 2 months of 10x3 pushups, etc., or small challenges like go running for 30 min on Wednesday). You can also issue a challenge to yourself. Default challenges based on skill level will be provided in-app in case people aren’t sure what challenges to issue.
2. Social Verification: Someone not participating in the challenge has to verify that you completed a step in the challenge.
3. Point System and Weekly/Monthly Ranking: Completion of steps of challenges and challenges themselves result in points. Number of participants and difficulty of challenge (frequency + intensity) all affect how many points a challenge is worth. Bonus points for when everyone in a challenge completes the challenge. Within your friend group, you can see who has the most points at the end of each week. Failure to complete a challenge results in loss of all points associated with that challenge.
4. Exercise Tracking: Completed exercise sessions are logged and stored so users can go back and see their activity. Completed challenges are also tracked.

## Ethical Analysis

1. This app relies on the trustworthiness of users. Verification, which underpins the point system, relies on both the verifier and the verify-ee. This could easily be taken advantage of. But since this is an app meant to help users develop healthy exercise habits, it’s ultimately in all users best interest to be as honest as possible; points in an app mean much less than actual improvement in real life.
2. Some users may not be that educated on what are reasonable challenges; this could result in users participating in challenges that are too difficult for their skill level and injuring themselves. Part of our design will include some basic default challenges that users can issue depending on their experience so that those with less experience can start somewhere without going too extreme.
3. This app is geared towards community formation. The more users participate in a challenge, the higher the point rewards are for completing the challenge. Verification also requires individuals not in the challenge for verification, which forces people to interact with at least one other person to get any points.
4. The app would make existing friendships closer, especially between those that are physically active, and would likely redistribute time amongst friend groups. The app could also cause tensions, especially if the friend is especially flakey or does not want to commit.
5. This app encourages gym patronage, so it might be a good business decision for gyms to promote the app. An extension of the app could also be gym-specific app versions, where you have to go to a specific gym to get points.
6. For users concerned with privacy, the public viewability of challenges might be uncomfortable for them. It might then be reasonable to allow privacy settings for different challenges. However this raises concerns with transparency – if people can’t see what challenges a user is completing, they might not trust their points.
