# Problem Framing

## Domain

WILG administration: WILG has a lot of complex processes behind the scenes that help keep the house running that are currently run manually. There is a cooking schedule with dinner 6x a week, all cooked by house members, and groceries need to be ordered for these dinners and for general snacks/breakfast. There is also a chore system involving kitchen jobs, house jobs and bathroom jobs. Since WILG does not have a cleaning service, these jobs are extremely important in keeping the house functional and livable.

## Problem

WILG Chores: Assigning chores and tracking chore completion. This is done via a Google form and witnessing system that our house managers have to manually track and collect every month. Missed chores result in fines, but these fines increase exponentially, not linearly. People also can swap chores, which has to be tracked manually. A lot of the tasks involved here (tracking hours, calculating fines) can be automated. Additionally, having a place where people can see which jobs they've logged (which currently is not available) would be really useful for residents.

## Evidence

1. [Communal Intimacy: Formalization, Egalitarianism, and Exchangeability in Collective Housing](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/100/1/273/5933783?login=true). This research paper discusses how communal living tends to demand egalitarianism in the distribution of chores and tasks in comparison to family living, and that this egalitarianism actually contributes to communal intimacy.

2. [Co-Housing to Ease and Share Household Chores? Spatial Visibility and Collective Deliberation as Levers for Gender Equality](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/11/5/189) This research paper discusses how in one investigation into co-housing projects in Brussels, egalitarian distribution of chores within a shared communal living space can ease burdens on individuals and allow women to lead more socially and politically engaged lives.

3. [Why Communal Living Can Make Us Happier](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240429-why-living-with-strangers-can-make-us-happier). This article discusses how communal living systems that involve chore schedules and cooking plans or other modes of shared responsibility can help provide community and alleviate burdens.

4. Personal Experience: One of the team members, Alexis, is president of WILG, and has experience working with the house managers. When house managers are really hosed, a lot of chore tracking gets delayed. If this was automated, we wouldn't experience this problem at all.

## Comparables

1. [OurHome](http://ourhomeapp.com/). A family chore tracking app that allows families to track chores and assigns points to those who complete their chores. Good for a family, but not super compatible with WILG, which is a 30+ member community with very specific chores that come with specific time frames. This app also does not have chore swapping or fine tracking.
